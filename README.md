# 2022-2023 MLDS Long Competition

This is the repository for the 2022-2023 MLDS long competition!

Here is the presentation introducing it: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ywo1iH7-kyAyFlwltEUqZwt2IwVsj9GE/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109834989667114078415&rtpof=true&sd=true

After cloning this repository, start by making sure that you have all the dependencies required. You can do so by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Also note that you will need Python 3.9 or above. We recommend doing all of this in a virtual environment.

Now you should be able to run a sample battle by running "main.py." For creating your own battle algorithm, you can start out by modifying the myAgent() function in "main.py" (or rather, by creating a new function to act as a new agent). However, for more complex algorithms such as those using reinforcement learning, you should be able to create a new class, subclassing the Agent class from "agent.py" in your own file.
